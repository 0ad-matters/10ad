# 10ad

Mod for [0ad](https://play0ad.com/); faster (and cheaper) economy
upgrades and fewer houses required.


## Details

These upgrades are all free and very fast to complete.

### Storehouse and Farmhouse

You can do the upgrades immediately after building them. There is only
one upgrade for each resource, but it increases your gathering rate to
the same value you'd get after doing the village, town, and city
upgrade in the unmodded version of 0ad.

### Housing

You can do the home garden upgrade immediately after building a house.
It will give you an 80% population bonus.
