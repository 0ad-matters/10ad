Mod for [0ad](https://play0ad.com/); Increased capacity and gather
rates are the default, free and fast town/city phase upgrades, and
fewer houses are required.

## Details

These upgrades are all free and very fast to complete.

### Storehouse and Farmhouse

Increased capacity and gather rates are the default, and there are
almost no eco upgrades available (Some civs, such as Gauls, still
offer an additional upgrade).

They are FAST and free.

You can do the home garden upgrade immediately after building a house.
It will give you an 80% population bonus.
